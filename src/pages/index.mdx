# Arguflow Documentation

Arguflow is the best GenAI platform for creating, managing, and searching embeddings then using them via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or your method of choice. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>

Semantic search and RAG are powerful primitives, but can take months to implement and deploy when accounting for all the little details like **chunking, maximal marginal relevance, filters, weighting, model-selection, and more.**
With Arguflow, you can complete and deploy a ChatGPT like experience or a semantic search engine on your data in a matter of hours.

</Note>

GenAI is **finally** ready for production with Arguflow.
