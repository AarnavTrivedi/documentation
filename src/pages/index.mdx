# Arguflow Vault API Documentation

<Note>
  Warning! Vault API is in early alpha and breaking changes will likely occur!
</Note>

Use the managed Arguflow Vault API or a self-hosted instance to create, manage, store, and search embeddings for your product or service. We promise that it will be easier than building embedding pipelines from scratch. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="not-prose mb-16 mt-6 flex gap-3">
  <Button href="/quickstart" arrow="right" children="Quickstart" />
</div>

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

If you are interested in a managed instance, reach out to us by emailing contact@arguflow.gg. You can also create a self-hosted instance with the source code on our [GitHub](https://github.com/arguflow/ai-editor).

To engage with the Arguflow community, preferably join our [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#arguflow-general:matrix.zerodao.gg) or your preference of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/arguflow) or [Telegram](https://t.me/+vUOq6omKOn5lY2Zh).

Otherwise, if you are in a hurry to start seeing status codes, you can permissionlessly start using the API locally by following our [Self-Hosting Guide](/self-host-guide) to stand to vault up on your local machine.
