# Notifications

Notifications are messages sent from the server after certain events have finished running, such as verification and file creation. On this page, we’ll dive into the different conversation endpoints you can use to manage notifications programmatically. We'll look at how to query and mark notifications as read. {{ className: 'lead' }}
