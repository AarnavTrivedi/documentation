# Quickstart/Authentication

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Arguflow API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  This guide assumes you already have Arguflow running locally or have an
  Arguflow instance deployed. If you don't, check out the README{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/arguflow/arguflow">README</a> or{' '}
  <a href="/self-hosting-guide">self-hosting guide</a> to get started.
</Note>

## 1. Navigate to the search UI for your Arguflow instance and make an account or log in as the admin user

If you're running Arguflow locally, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the search UI. If you're using a deployed instance, you can navigate to the URL you deployed to.

## 2. Once you're logged in, navigate to the settings page

## 3. Create a new API key

Any given account is only allowed to have one API key. If you already have an API key and generate a new one, your old API key will be invalidated.

## 4. Upload your first document chunk

<Note>
  We call document chunks `cards` in the API.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```js {{ title: 'JavaScript' }}
fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    card_html: "My first card!"
  })
})
```

</CodeGroup>

## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further:
