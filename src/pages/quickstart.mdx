# Quickstart/Authentication

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Arguflow API. We'll cover how to get an authentication token and make your first API request with javascript. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. Here's a link to our <a href="https://www.postman.com/interstellar-escape-79389/workspace/arguflow-api-reference/collection/28637863-c7833c30-5c19-427f-9cab-e8a4f961511e?action=share&creator=28637873">Postman collection</a>.{{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Vault API, you will need to grab your api
  token.

## Create an account

1. Go to the Vault client at [https://vault.arguflow.ai](https://vault.arguflow.ai) and click the register button.
