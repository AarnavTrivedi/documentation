# Self Hosting

This guide will demonstrate how to self host the Vault API on your own server or a cloud provider of your choice.

## Prerequisites

- A server running Ubuntu 18.04 or later
- A domain name that you own
- A valid SSL certificate for your domain name
- A sendgrid account with an API key
- Some knowledge of reverse proxies and DNS

## Disclosure

If you meet all of the above prerequisites and want to self-host then please reach out to us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#arguflow-general:matrix.zerodao.gg) or [Github](https://github.com/arguflow/vault-server) and we will help you out.

We are still in a very early alpha stage and things are likely to make breaking changes, so we have not yet documented the process of self-hosting.

Further, Vault is not the same without the data and you would need to get in touch with us to get a copy of the data that we have collected so far anyways. We are working on publishing this data such that you can self-host without having to contact us at all.
