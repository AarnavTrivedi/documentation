# Self Hosting

This guide will demonstrate how to self host the Vault API on your own server or a cloud provider of your choice.

## Prerequisites

- A server running Ubuntu 18.04 or later
- A domain name that you own
- A valid SSL certificate for your domain name
- A sendgrid account with an API key
- Some knowledge of reverse proxies and DNS
- An OpenAI API key or Your own Self hosted model (more on that later)

## Step 1 - Configure DNS

    You will need to configure your DNS to point to your server. You can do this by creating an A record for each of the subdomains you want to use.

    ```
    A	<your-server-ip>	self-chat.arguflow.ai
    A	<your-server-ip>	self-api.arguflow.ai
    A	<your-server-ip>	self-search.arguflow.ai
    ```
## Step 2 - Install Docker on machine

Follow the guide here to install docker on your server: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

## Step 3 - Clone the repository


```sh {{ title: 'Shell' }}
git clone https://github.com/arguflow/arguflow
cd arguflow
```

## Step 4 - Configure the Environment Variables for the API

There are 3 files you need to modify
We have an example .env file in the root of the repository.
You can use this as a starting point for your own configuration.

```sh
cat .env.server .env.chat .env.search .env.docker-compose > .env
```

The main ENV variables you will need to update are:
```sh
# FOR SERVER
DATABASE_URL
QDRANT_URL
QDRANT_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY

# For CHAT
VITE_API_HOST=https://self-api.arguflow.ai/api
VITE_SEARCH_URL=https://self-api.arguflow.ai/api
# For SEARCH
PUBLIC_API_HOST=https://self-api.arguflow.ai/api
```

Everything else can be left as default but there are some passwords that may want to be hardened if this
is for production.

To see a full list of ENV variables and what they do please see the [env file](/envs.mdx)

## Step 5 - Setup docker compose

```sh {{ title: 'Shell' }}
docker compose up -d
```

This docker compose file will setup the following services:
- postgres
- Qdrant
- server
- chat
- search

We DO NOT reccomend to run Qdrant or Postgres on the same machine as the API.
You can use a managed database service such as AWS RDS or Neon (our prefernce) to host postgres.
and we reccomend using a differnt machine for Qdrant (Mainly just to prevent the chance of data loss).

## Step 6 - Configure Caddyfile
Install caddy using the instructions here: https://caddyserver.com/docs/install

We have an example Caddyfile in the root of the repository. You can use this as a starting point for your own configuration.

```
sudo cp Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

```{{ title: '/etc/caddy/Caddyfile' }}
# Global options
{
    email developer@arguflow.gg
}

# Define a site block for chat.arguflow.ai
self-chat.arguflow.ai {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}

# Define a site block for api.arguflow.ai
self-api.arguflow.ai {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8090
}

# Define a site block for search.arguflow.ai
self-search.arguflow.ai {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3001
}
```

Once you have this you can run the caddy daemon using systemctl
```
sudo systemctl enable caddy.service
sudo systemctl restart caddy.service
```


## Step 7 - Profit ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€

Congratulations you have now self hosted the Arguflow API. You can now use the API by navigating to your domain name in your browser on either chat or search.
