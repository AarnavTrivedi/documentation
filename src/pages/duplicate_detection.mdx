# Card duplicates

One of the stand-out features of Trieve is how we detect and handle duplicates. In this guide, we’ll look at how Trieve handles duplicates to achieve maximal-marginal-relevance (MMR). {{ className: 'lead' }}

Our primary competitors like Vectara and Pinecone are flat out missing this feature with no intent to implement it. This is a huge advantage for Trieve, as it allows us to provide a much better user experience.

## What is MMR?

Maximal-marginal-relevance (MMR) is a technique used in information retrieval to select a diverse set of results. It is used to prevent redundancy in search results, and is used in Trieve to prevent duplicate cards from being returned in search results on a top-level.

## Why do we call duplicates "collisions" in Trieve?

When you vector'ize data with an embedding model, you are converting it into a vector that exists in some `n` dimensional space.

The distance between two vectors is then the the "similarity" between the two pieces of data. Vectors can be close enough that you can imagine them actually colliding in the `n` dimensional space as a "semantic collision".

In Trieve, you can set an environment variable called `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` to determine how similar two vectors have to be to be considered a duplicate. The default value is `0.95`, which means that if two vectors have a cosine similarity of 0.95 or above, they are considered duplicates.

## How Trieve's business logic for handling duplicates works

### 1. The CardCollisions model

We create the `card_collisions` SQL table in [this migration](https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve/blob/main/server/migrations/2023-06-15-202339_create-card-collision-table/up.sql). There are a couple of sub-sequent migrations to edit the table, but the core of the table is created in that migration.

The CardCollisions model is then defined in [this file](https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve/blob/main/server/src/data/models.rs#L354C1-L374) as shown below:

```rs
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Queryable, Selectable, Insertable, Clone)]
#[diesel(table_name = card_collisions)]
pub struct CardCollisions {
    pub id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub card_id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub collision_qdrant_id: Option<uuid::Uuid>,
    pub created_at: chrono::NaiveDateTime,
    pub updated_at: chrono::NaiveDateTime,
}
```

Each `CardCollisions` row will relate to a `CardMetadata` row in the `card_metadata` table via the `card_id` column. The `collision_qdrant_id` column is used to relate the `CardCollisions` row to a `Qdrant` point in the `qdrant` db.

### 2. When a card is created, we check for collisions

When a card is created, we find the nearest point using a function called `first_semantic_result` as follows:

```rs
let first_semantic_result = global_unfiltered_top_match_query(embedding_vector.clone())
  .await
  .map_err(|err| {
      ServiceError::BadRequest(format!(
          "Could not get semantic similarity for collision check: {}",
          err.message
      ))
  })?;
```

### 3. If the `first_semantic_result` is within the `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` of `0.95`, we create a `CardCollisions` row and not a `Qdrant` point

If the `first_semantic_result` is within the `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` of `0.95`, we then only create a `CardCollisions` row and not a `Qdrant` point. This is because we don't want to create a `Qdrant` point for a duplicate card. It will worsen search time performance and prevent MMR from working.

The implementation of this logic can be found in [card_handler.rs here](https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve/blob/main/server/src/handlers/card_handler.rs#L211-L323).

## The result in our default search UI

If you search for ["Enron’s liquidity is very solid and there is no need for any panic or alarm"](https://enron-search.arguflow.ai/search?q=Enron%E2%80%99s%20liquidity%20is%20very%20solid%20and%20there%20is%20no%20need%20for%20any%20panic%20or%20alarm) on our Enron demo then you will see arrows on the sides of resulting cards as shown below:

These arrows allow you to navigate between cards that are duplicates of each other.
