## Additional Notes

The server can also store images if you are going to use `PUBLIC_IMAGE_RANGE_START_KEY` and `PUBLIC_IMAGE_RANGE_END_KEY`, the server expects for the images to be located mounted in /app/images.

If you want S3 support for images, please reach out to us at contact@arguflow.gg or matrix and maybe open an issue on github.
