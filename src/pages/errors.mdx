# Errors

In this guide, we will talk about what happens when something goes wrong while you work with the API. Mistakes happen, and are somewhat difficult to debug when you are working with an API. 

Unfortunately, the Vault API is still in alpha and does not yet have very descriptive error messages. However, we are working on improving this, if you are interested in helping please reach out on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#arguflow-general:matrix.zerodao.gg) or [Github](https://github.com/arguflow/vault-server).

<Note>
  If you cannot figure out how to address an error, please reach out on
  [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#arguflow-general:matrix.zerodao.gg) or
  [Github](https://github.com/arguflow/vault-server) and we will help you out.

## Status codes

Here is a list of the different categories of status codes returned by the Vault API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.

<Properties>
  <Property name="2xx">
    A 2xx status code indicates a successful response.
  </Property>
  <Property name="4xx">
    A 4xx status code indicates a client error — this means it's a _you_
    problem.
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error — you won't be seeing these.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Error data structure

<Row>
  <Col>

    More often than not, 4xx status codes will be returned with an error response. This is a JSON object with the following structure:

    <Properties>
      <Property name="message">
        Some human-readable text describing the error.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
  <Col>

    ```bash {{ title: "Error response" }}
    {
      "message": "No way this is happening!?",
    }
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>
